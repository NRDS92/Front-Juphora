A modern and responsive e-commerce frontend built with React, Vite, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
This project is designed to deliver a fast and seamless shopping experience while maintaining a clean and scalable codebase.

🚀 Features

useCallback: Memoize callback functions for better performance in event handlers and expensive computations.
useContext: Provide global state management for user authentication, cart, and theme without prop drilling.

🛍 Product Listing & Filtering: Browse products by category, price range, and search keywords.
🛒 Shopping Cart: Add, update, and remove items with dynamic price calculations.
🧾 Checkout Flow: Streamlined process for a real-world shopping experience (ready to integrate with backend APIs).
